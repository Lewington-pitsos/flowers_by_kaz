      <h6>Business Ethos</h6>
      <p class="delicate">
        Most Florist shops produce huge amounts of plastic waste that is not recycled and goes to landfill, contributing to environmental degradation. Flowers by Kaz strives to work in a way that improves environmental sustainability, by avoiding the use of plastic, recycling and reusing where possible, minimising waste in general, as well as using green waste disposal.
      </p>
      <p class="delicate">
         By opting for containers as a fresh water source, I avoid the use of floral foam â€“ which is constructed from plastic and chemical additives, and is not biodegradable. Furthermore, using paper to wrap flowers instead of plastic sheets. Paper not only gives a fresh, natural look, it can be recycled and is safer for the environment, as well as being better for protecting flowers from bruising and breaking.
